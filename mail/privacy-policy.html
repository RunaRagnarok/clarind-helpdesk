    <h2>Data processing</h2>

    <h3>Accessing the website and log-files</h3>

    <p>
      For every visit and page view, information is collected into the
      log files by the server. The data stored in log files may include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>your IP address (will be anonymised after one week)</li>
      <li>the page being viewed</li>
      <li>amount of data transferred</li>
      <li>information about browser and operating system</li>
      <li>date and time for the access</li>
      <li>web sites from which you came to our web site</li>
      <li>websites accessed by the User’s system through our website</li>
      <li>whether the access was successful</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The temporary storage of data and log files is lawful pursuant to Art. 6
      (1) lit. f General Data Protection Regulation
      (Datenschutz-Grundverordnung—DSGVO)
    </p>

    <p>
      The IP address is temporarily stored in the system as it is necessary to
      provide website access to the User’s computer. The IP address is retained
      while that website is being accessed.

    <p>
      These log files are stored to ensure website functionality, optimize the
      content of our website, and ensure the security of our IT system.
    </p>

    <p>
      The data will be deleted when they are no longer needed for the purpose
      they were collected. For data collected to provide access to the website,
      this will be at the end of every session.
    </p>

    <p>
      For log files, this will occur after seven days at the latest. Some data
      may be preserved for a longer period of time, in which case user IP
      addresses are deleted or removed, rendering it impossible to link the
      data to any individual.
    </p>
